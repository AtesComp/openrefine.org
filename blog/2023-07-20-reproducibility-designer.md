## About you - who are you?

We're searching for a dedicated part-time designer who will play a leading role in enhancing the usability of OpenRefine. Your background includes experience with FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and engagement with diverse communities that intersect with OpenRefine's user base.

Collaborating with the OpenRefine volunteer designer community, you'll be involved in the following:
* Research design limitations and identify opportunities for improvement.
* Designing changes to the user interface to support enhancements and new features.
* Conducting user testing sessions to validate design choices.
* Prioritizing improvements based on user feedback.

We anticipate an initial phase of intense design activity at the project's outset, which will transition to periodic and responsive support as the project advances into the implementation stage.

## The mission 

Key projects you'll contribute to include:

**Improvements to OpenRefine's Operation History**
As part of a project funded by the [Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/improving-openrefines-reproducibility/), we are working on improving OpenRefine's operation history and reproducibility guarantees. This work addresses long-standing issues currently tracking in [Improving OpenRefine's reproducibility GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenRefine/projects/6). Specifically, you'll be involved in:
* Designing graphical representations of sequences of operations to address limitations associated with the Undo/Redo functionality, encompassing the ability to undo operations mid-history and mitigating unintended work loss during undo and new operation application 
* Addressing long-standing issues when reusing and sharing OpenRefine workflows due to the lack of error handling when applying a series of operations and the difficulty of adapting a workflow to a new project 
* Enhancing sharing and reusability of OpenRefine workflows as part of an automated pipeline without using the web interface

**Ad-Hoc Design Needs**
You'll team up with the [@OpenRefine/designers group](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?q=team%3AOpenRefine%2Fdesigners), addressing ad-hoc design needs flagged by the community. Your design skills will be pivotal in refining user interfaces while maintaining design consistency by adhering to and improving OpenRefine's design system and guidelines.

Additional funding or community requests may broaden the scope of the work. For instance, ongoing discussions include improving user onboarding workflow and addressing cultural and linguistic diversity limitations. As these projects evolve, your designer perspective will help refine their scope and ensure a successful implementation.
