title: "OpenRefine receives a new NFDI grant to improve its reconciliation features"
---
[NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en) has awarded OpenRefine a EUR 10,000 grant to enhance its reconciliation feature. This grant builds upon the progress made in 2022 with Wikibase and Wikimedia Commons integration and paves the way for more user-friendly reconciliation services, connecting with the [50+ existing reconciliation services](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/testbench/#/).

**Planned Working Packages.**

OpenRefine's upcoming improvements are based on feedback collected during the testing of Wikibase and Wikimedia Commons integration and leverage existing design wireframes.

1. **Redesigning and Redeveloping the Reconciliation Service Dialog Interface**: This aims to enhance the clarity and ease of use of the reconciliation dialog within OpenRefine.

2. **Improving Display of Reconciled Data to Users**: Particularly addressing cases where multiple external databases are used as reconciliation endpoints and improving the display of data reconciled against different sources, including media files such as thumbnail previews.

3. **Enhancing the Data Enrichment Process**: This involves improvements in user messaging within the data enrichment UI and better presentation of data after enrichment processes, making the origin of new data readily recognizable.

4. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Enhancements in error messaging for cases arising from reconciliation or enrichment, before users upload their data and/or media files to their intended repository.

The above tasks will be executed over a period of 5 months between August and December 2023.
