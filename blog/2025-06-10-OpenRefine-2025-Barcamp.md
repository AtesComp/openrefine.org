## Overview

**Join us to discuss the past, present, and future of the OpenRefine project from Monday, September 8, to Thursday, September 11, 2025.** This online event is open to all members of the OpenRefine community, as well as partners and stakeholders who are interested in helping to shape the project's future.

### What is a Barcamp?

A Barcamp is a participant-driven event: the agenda is shaped by *you*, the community. There are no pre-selected keynotes or speakers; this is an open invitation to propose sessions, join discussions, and share what matters most to you. Whether you're new to OpenRefine, looking to contribute ideas for the roadmap, or exploring technical details, this is your space to collaborate and connect.

### Proposing a Session 

**Sessions can be proposed on our [forum](https://forum.openrefine.org/c/community/community-events/18) using the `barcamp-2025`¬†tag**. We invite participants to review, discuss and vote on sessions proposed prior to the event. We will select which sessions will go on the agenda during the planning session on Monday September 8.

**Here are some session ideas** we'd love to see based on last the [Barcamp 2024](https://forum.openrefine.org/tag/barcamp-2024) and past feedback:
- UX feedback and user experience discussions
- Hands-on code sprints or documentation writing
- Issue triage parties
- Feature scoping and roadmap input
- Updates from developers on recent work
- Tips from trainers and educators
- ...or any other topic *you* want to propose!

At least one participant must propose a session for it to be included in the planning day agenda.
