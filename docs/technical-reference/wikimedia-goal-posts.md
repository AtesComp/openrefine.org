### Better support for self hosted Wikidata instances.
- **Score**: 24
- **Status**: Needs Scoping
- **Source**: Prioritization-2024
- **Comment**: This include setting up manifests, and creating data previews (when reconciling) is full of dark secrets. Wikibase cloud reconciliation. Improved integration with Wikibase would be important to me because right now I have to make do with some workarounds that can be time-consuming. See [this thread](https://forum.openrefine.org/t/fundraising-to-commission-the-development-of-a-mediawiki-extension-for-reconciliation-with-wikibase/1645) regarding the effort to make this process easier.
