# OpenRefine Ecosystem

The OpenRefine ecosystem comprises the OpenRefine project, which maintains the OpenRefine software, user forums, documentation, and user groups that contextualize OpenRefine for their communities' usage.

Those user groups include data journalists, semantic web enthusiasts, Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums (GLAM), researchers, or members of the Wikimedia Movement. Each community provides advocacy, training, and support activities via mediums relevant to its members, with little coordination between them. For instance, libraries host training sessions for archivists, librarians, and researchers; workshops are organized during data journalism conferences; and a dedicated Telegram channel is available for Wikimedians seeking support.

Third-party developers create new extensions and reconciliation services compatible with OpenRefine. Reconciliation services allow users to link their datasets with a knowledge graph, while extensions add domain-specific features or integrate OpenRefine into a particular workflow. These services expand OpenRefine's capabilities, enabling users to accomplish their tasks more efficiently.

Finally, the Advisory Committee is responsible for OpenRefine funding and administrative tasks to support the ecosystem.

The following graphic represents the relationship between OpenRefine and its user communities. Click on the ðŸ”— for more details on each node. The blue section represents activities coordinated by the OpenRefine project.
