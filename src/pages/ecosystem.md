# OpenRefine Ecosystem

The OpenRefine ecosystem is built around the OpenRefine projet who maintain OpenRefine, the user forum and OpenRefine documentation, and users group who contextualize OpenRefine for their communities usage. 

Those user group include data journalist, semantic web enthousiasts, Galleries, Libraries, Archives,and Museums (GLAM), researchers or member of the Wikimedia Mouvement. Each communities provide advocacy, training and support activities via medium relevant for their community. For example, libraries host training sessions for archivists, librarians, and researchers ; workshops are organized at data journalist conferences ; and dedicated telegram channel are open to support Wikimedians.

Third-party developers create new extensions and reconciliation services compatible with OpenRefine. Reconciliation services allow users to link their datasets with a knowledge graph, while extensions add domain-specific features or integrate OpenRefine into a particular workflow. These services expand the capabilities of OpenRefine, enabling users to accomplish their data-related tasks more efficiently.
 
Finally the Advisory Committee is responsible for OpenRefine funding and adminstrative task to support the ecosystem.
