## OpenRefine Vision
 
A more informed world where working with data is easy and engaging.

## OpenRefine Mission

Empowering everyone to meaningfully engage with data by providing an accessible open source tool and nurturing a diverse, supportive community.

## OpenRefine Values 

We recognize that building and supporting a tool that meets the important vision and mission of OpenRefine necessitates a values-driven community. The values below refer to the community’s core principles and ethics. These values directly map onto the principles embedded into the tool itself and are reected in how OpenRefine, the tool, is conceptualized, built, maintained, taught, and used.

* Respectful of Diverse Backgrounds & Expertise
* Approachable
* Transparent & Open
* Curious
* Community-driven

### Respectful of Diverse Backgrounds & Expertise

We celebrate that people come to the OpenRefine tool and community from varying backgrounds, identities, technical abilities, geographies, privileges, industries, linguistic backgrounds, and more. We honor the experiences of our users and contributors and aim to develop features and training that encourage and nourish diverse engagement with the tool, prioritizing accessibility and usability to broaden reach and impact.

### Approachable

We ensure that OpenRefine is inviting and supportive of all participants by providing various on-ramps to engagement with the tool and community, including but not limited to clear documentation, thoughtful mentorship and training, and by prioritizing ease-of-use and participation across backgrounds and skill-levels. We expect everyone to engage with kindness, warmth, patience, and an unwavering commitment to mutual support.

### Transparent & Open

We create pathways for and encourage clear communication and knowledge-sharing, ranging from regularly-updated documentation to consistent public participation in community forums. We believe that transparent practices are essential to a collaborative community where all participants – including those with limited time and experience – are informed and feel empowered to engage. The tool mirrors this commitment to transparency through prioritizing the use of open and commons-based data, and the privacy of all users.

### Curious

We believe in the importance of a learning mindset, where everyone leads with questions and engages with humility. We recognize that we have a lot to learn from one another, and seek opportunities to foster our mutual growth. This includes being thoughtful in how we give and receive feedback, consistently examining our own biases, and providing proactive support to new learners in our community. For the tool itself, we operate with humility and listen to end-users to prioritize their needs and plan for features and iterations that optimize their use of the tool.

### Community-driven

We seek to facilitate a sense of community among users and contributors, and to prioritize the perspectives of community members in key decisions. We believe that our users and contributors define OpenRefine, and should collaboratively drive our work forward – not as individuals but as members of a supportive and vibrant community. This is reflected in open communication about the future of the community and tool, a sense of agency among community members, and in democratic decision-making around strategic and technical priorities.
