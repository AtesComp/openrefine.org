Using refine.ini for configuration
Error: OpenRefine isn't running on http://127.0.0.1:3333/. Maybe a proxy issue?
--------------------------------------------
I already posted the error on the forum but until now I got no working solutions.

PS: To be sure I just downloaded and launched the latest version of refine 3.8.2 for linux. It's not working => I have no choice to use a Windows VM locally to continue working.
I also use all the linux commands I know and those I found to be able to find the problem but I get nothing useful enough to make it work.
